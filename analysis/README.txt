The included .yml file is the conda environment utilized for the analysis of membrane trajectories. 

bending-analysis-v1.1.py contains all needed information for determining the bending modulus of q^-4 and RSF. BW-DCF needs to have c-matrix.py run first, the results of which are called in bending-analysis-v1.1.py and used to determine the BW-DCF bending modulus.
